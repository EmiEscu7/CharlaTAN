  # Here put stories that must be used by TourPolicy to calculate intents
  # weights for a specific dimension level. This stories must simulate a real
  # conversation between the assistant and the person who is doing the tour, so
  # intents weights are related to the learning style of that person.
  # The required format is train_<dimension_name>_<dimension_level_name>.
  # There must be implemented a tour.conversation.Iterator subclass whose name is
  # equal to <dimension_level_name>, so intents weights for this story are
  # mapped to the conversation.

  # Example of a training story. Check that intents and actions exist in your
  # domain.
